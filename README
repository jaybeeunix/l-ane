LanePOS is an integrated Point-Of-Sale (POS) and backoffice system for cash-
register-like computer systems. It allows a business to track inventory,
sales, and customers in a single or multi register system. This system allows
any backoffice computer to access the system for reporting or modification
(via an X11 wrapper like VNC).

This file describes the newer, Perl-based configuration files, which
are located in this directory.

The following files are needed for L'anePOS to function:

init.pl 
	This file contains common initialization code for L'ane.
	It also contains platform-specific code for non-Unix/POSIX
	and pseudo-POSIX platforms. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! THIS FILE
	DOES NOT CONTAIN SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION OPTIONS!

site.pl
	This file contains site-specific configuration options, in the
	form described below. The previous %ENV based settings
	OVERRIDE the settings in this file. If you want to make
	configuration changes in L'ane, put those changes in this
	file.

site.pl Options
===============
site.pl is Perl, so most Perl code will work here. You should only put
universally need code here, as almost everything includes this
file. Obviously this file should allow read access only for the users
who actually use L'anePOS and write access only for the
administrator.

$ENV{'LaneDSN'} = 'dbname=lanetest host=localhost';
	The datasource name.

$ENV{'LaneLang'} = 'int-EURO.REVISO,fr-BE,fr,nl-BE,nl,en-UK,en,c';
	The comma, semicolon, or whitespace separated list of locales
	in order of most to least desirable. For example, French in
	Belgium with an ASCII Euro might be:
	"int-EURO.REVISO,fr-BE,fr,nl-BE,nl,en-UK,en,c".

$ENV{'LaneDebug'} = 'ClassName orOtherSpecifier';
	This option enables debugging messages for the specified
	classes or other specifiers. Older classes and programs enable
	debugging messages when this variable is set to any true
	value.

NOTE:	'LaneRoot' is now determined by the various programs, so it
	shouldn't be included in the 'site.pl' file.
